PixelPainter allows you to paint anything your heart desires. It has a color swatch of multiple colors and a grid size that fits a TV! When a user clicks on a color from the swatch they can paint the color on the pixel grid! Thereâ€™s also two buttons, one for erasing a color and the other to clear the entire canvas.
